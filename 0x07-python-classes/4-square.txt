Expected Successes:
===================

# size is int
my_square = Square(9)

# size is large int
my_square = Square(100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)

# no size passed
my_square = Square()


Expected Failures:
==================

# size is not int
my_square = Square("size")

# size is negative
my_square = Square(-17)
